# PETRONAS Twin Tower — Visitor Management System (Prototype)

This repository contains a prototype Visitor Management System (VMS) for the PETRONAS Twin Towers developed using FlutterFlow and exported to Flutter. The app is a proof-of-concept demonstrating visitor registration, check-in/out flows, and basic integrations with Firebase.

Status: Prototype — intended for demo and early development only.

## About

This project started as a FlutterFlow design and was exported to Flutter for customization. It provides a starting point for a visitor management workflow tailored for the PETRONAS Twin Towers: capturing visitor details, photo upload, check-in/out, and storing records in Firestore.

## Key features

- Visitor registration form (name, company, purpose, photo)
- Visitor check-in and check-out flows
- Firebase Authentication integration (basic)
- Firestore for visitor records
- Firebase Storage for media uploads
- Example Cloud Functions present in `firebase/functions/`
- Responsive UI exported from FlutterFlow

## Project structure (important paths)

- `lib/` — main Flutter source code (generated by FlutterFlow + manual edits)
- `android/` — Android app configuration; `android/app/google-services.json` lives here
- `ios/Runner/` — iOS app configuration; `GoogleService-Info.plist` lives here
- `assets/` — images, fonts, media
- `firebase/` — Firestore rules, indexes, storage rules, and Cloud Functions
- `firebase/functions/` — sample Cloud Functions (Node.js)

## Setup & run (development)

Prerequisites

- Install Flutter SDK (use the version compatible with this project; check `pubspec.yaml`).
- Install the Firebase CLI if you plan to deploy functions or rules.
- Create a Firebase project and enable the required services (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions if used).

1) Get dependencies

```powershell 
flutter pub get
```

2) Verify Firebase configuration

- Android: place your `google-services.json` at `android/app/google-services.json`.
- iOS: place your `GoogleService-Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it to the Xcode project.

The repository may include sample Firebase configuration files. Replace them with files from your Firebase console for your project.

3) Run the app

```powershell
flutter run
```

## Firebase configuration & deployment

- Firestore rules: `firebase/firestore.rules`
- Firestore indexes: `firebase/firestore.indexes.json`
- Storage rules: `firebase/storage.rules`
- Cloud Functions: `firebase/functions/`

To deploy functions (example):

```powershell
cd firebase/functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Make sure you've run `firebase login` and selected the correct project (`firebase use --add`) before deploying.

## Building for release

- Android (APK):

```powershell
flutter build apk --release
```

- Android (App Bundle):

```powershell
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## Testing

Run tests (if present):

```powershell
flutter test
```

## Notes & limitations

- This is a prototype exported from FlutterFlow. The generated code follows FlutterFlow conventions and may require careful refactoring.
- Security: review Firebase rules and Auth flows before using real user data.
- Data retention and privacy practices are not implemented — add them for production.

## Credits

- UI and flows created with FlutterFlow.
- Firebase integration and sample functions included as examples.
